    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>VoltEdge Supply is an independent reseller specializing in low voltage industrial parts, primarily ABB components, for commercial applications. Our mission is to support MRO teams and electrical contractors with reliable access to high-quality components — without inflated costs or unnecessary delays.</p>

    <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>We started VoltEdge with a simple goal: make sourcing electrical components less frustrating. No gatekeeping, no corporate nonsense — just straightforward support and dependable parts that help keep your operations running.</p>

    <h2>How We Operate</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Zero-inventory startup: We dropship direct from our suppliers to reduce cost.</li>
      <li>We quote fast and accurately — typically within 24 hours.</li>
      <li>Self-funded, self-marketed, and built to scale responsibly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    <p>Right now, we're a lean operation — with plans to grow. We combine smart tools (AI-assisted backend) and sharp minds (real humans when it counts) to keep our service both fast and personal.</p>
